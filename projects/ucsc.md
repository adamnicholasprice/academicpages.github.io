<h3> Current Research </h3>
Currently, I am studying seafloor hydrothermal systems in Dr. Andrew Fisher's Hydrogeology Lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Being that it is early on in the process of my doctoral studies I have a wide birth of topics I am interested in which include but are not limited to:
- Numerical modeling of hydrothermal processes on MOR flank sedimentary basins
- Crustal permeability of Mid/Fast mid ocean ridge crustal complexes
- Hydrothermal/geothermal reservoir characterization

Please see my latest blog posts on research developments and more insight in to the marine hydrogeology side of the Fisher Lab!
