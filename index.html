<p>I am a Ph.D. Student in the
  <a target="_blank" href="https://eps.ucsc.edu"> Earth and Planetary Sciences</a> department at the University of
  California, Santa Cruz with a focus (and passion) on Hydrogeology.
    I conduct research in <a target="_blank" href="https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/%7Eafisher/">Dr.
      Andrew Fisher's Hydrogeology Lab</a>, where I investigate hydrothermal
      systems in many different locals from marine, terrestrial, and extra-terrestrial!
    My research interests include geothermal heat flux in porous
    and fractured media, use of analytical mathematics to solve complex hydrologic
    issues, and implementation of near-surface geophysical techniques
    to better inform hydrologic models.


  Please take a look through my site and feel free to
  <a target="_blank" href="mailto:adnprice@ucsc.edu">contact me </a>
  if you have any questions or would be interested in working together! </p>
