My research with the University of Idaho Computational Hydrology Group involved
using many geophysical and analytic mathematical techniques to address complex
hydrogeological phenomena.

### Research Topics
- Geophysical Classification of Hot Spring Expression in Yellowstone National Park
- Analytical Modeling of Heat and Fluid Flow Pathways in Hydrothermal settings
- Seismic Data Analysis
