<h3> USGS National Research Program: Modeling of Watershed Systems Group</h3>
During the summer of 2017, I was nominated and received the [NAGT/USGS summer internship](https://nagt.org/nagt/students/usgs_field.html) which took place at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado. I completed investigations of representing the hydrologic cycle at a national scale as well as tools for model evaluation and improvement. I collected, processed, and identified CONUS scale recharge datasets that would better inform the National Hydrologic Model, specifically [Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System](https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/SW_MoWS/PRMS.html)
