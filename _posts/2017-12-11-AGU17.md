<h2> I was fortunate to travel and present my recently accepted research on hydrothermal systems at the AGU Fall Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana!
During my time there I enjoyed much of what the city had to offer and
met with many colleagues and potential collaborators! Check out the link below
for slides and a plain language summary.
