<h1> Bio </h1>

I am a **hydrogeologist** and a Ph.D. candidate in the
  <a href="https://eps.ucsc.edu"> Earth and Planetary Sciences </a>
  department at the University of California, Santa Cruz,
  interested in making discoveries of the hydro(geo)logical world through
  the combined use of analytical mathematics, numerical simulation, statistical inference,
  and machine learning methods.

I conduct research in both **<a href="https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/%7Eafisher/">Dr.
      Andrew Fisher's Hydrogeology Lab</a>**, where I investigate the coupled fluxes of
      heat and fluid through crustal aquifers in marine, terrestrial, and extra-terrestrial
      settings, and also with **<a href="http://mzimmer.weebly.com/">
      Dr. Margaret Zimmer's Watershed Hydrology Lab</a>** gaining a better understanding
      of drying processes of non-perennial rivers.

If you are interested in collaboration, please
